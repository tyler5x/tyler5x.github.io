- title: Software Engineering Intern, MathWorks
  from: May 2024
  to: August 2024
  description: I developed a MATLAB tool that constructs GPS messages in accordance with industry-standard formatting requirements. 
              Additionally, I revamped the test suite to enhance its efficiency, achieving an 80% reduction in runtime while maintaining 
              full test coverage. I also led the initiative to migrate the Gazebo simulation test suite from a VM-based to a Docker-based workflow, 
              streamlining the testing process and improving overall performance.

- title: Test Engineering Intern, Tesla
  from: May 2023
  to: August 2023
  description: I initiated the design and prototyping of a non-destructive crack measurement device using the AC Potential Difference method, 
    conducting sensitivity and power output testing to validate the equipment. 
    Additionally, I created a Python pipeline to digitally filter out signals 
    outside of the desired frequency range and attenuate noise, ensuring more accurate measurements.

- title: Mechatronics Intern, J&J Surgical Robotics
  from: May 2022
  to: August 2022
  description: I designed custom test fixtures to ensure surgical robot components complied with regulatory standards and internal design constraints. 
    These fixtures required custom mechanical, electrical, and control systems and testing tasks included lifecycle, impact, and deflection testing 
    under applied loads. I programmed extensively in the Arduino IDE to integrate a suite of sensors, actuators, and manual user controls into a reliable test setup.

- title: Sustaining Engineering Intern, Formlabs
  from: May 2021
  to: August 2021
  description: I was on the Sustaining Engineering Team, where I diagnosed and resolved problems for SLA and SLS printers.
   Some projects included improving resin tracking accuracy scripts, 
   reducing packaging weight, and investigating the cause of poor LED 
   calibrations and unexpected RTD values.

- title: Manufacturing Engineering Intern, Tesla
  from: January 2021
  to: May 2021
  description: I was part of the Model 3 General Assembly Equipment Engineering Team, where I designed manufacturing equipment for 
    assembly line improvement projects. I worked with process, safety, and ergonomics teams to develop design constraints for
    equipment solutions that reduced headcount, cycle times, and factory space. I also worked with other manufacturing engineers 
    to develop and refine my designs and with fabrication shops to make the parts. Some of my projects included designing locking 
    dollies and docking stations to reliably transport vehicle components within the factory, as well as actuating door supports 
    that hold the Model 3 doors in the right place while bolts are installed.

- title: Mechanical Engineering Intern, Dupont
  from: August 2020
  to: December 2020
  description: I worked with mechanical and industrial engineers to improve the reliability and efficiency of manufacturing processes.
   Some projects included designing new equipment to reduce cycle times and increase tool longevity, visualizing and analyzing part 
   data from the testing lab, and using VBA to schedule maintenance tasks based on PM schedules and man hours available.
