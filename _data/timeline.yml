- title: Software Engineering Intern, MathWorks
  from: May 2024
  to: August 2024
  description: I was part of the software quality team, where I worked on creating robust test suites to ensure the reliability and runtime
              efficiency of MATLAB functions in the DSP and robotics toolboxes. I improved the performance of many test suites, and was able to achieve
              as much as 80% reduction in runtime while maintaining full test coverage. I also led an initiative to migrate a Gazebo
              simulation test suite from a VM-based to a Docker-based workflow, streamlining the testing process and improving overall performance.
              Other projects include developing MATLAB function prototypes, including one that constructs GPS messages in accordance with 
              industry-standard formatting requirements. 

- title: Test Engineering Intern, Tesla
  from: May 2023
  to: August 2023
  description: I designed and ran experiments to investigate the performance of electrical busbars under changing power and thermal conditions. 
    To optimize the testing process, I built a custom test fixture to increase testing throughput by 200%, and I analyzed data in python to 
    inform future testing and decision making. I also initiated the design and prototyping of a non-destructive crack measurement device 
    that used the AC Potential Difference method to measure the depth of cracks in die-cast tooling. This required designing custom equipment 
    to take precise measurements and conducting sensitivity and power output testing to validate the equipment. Additionally, I created a 
    Python pipeline to digitally filter out signals outside of the desired frequency range and attenuate noise, ensuring more accurate measurements.

- title: Mechatronics Intern, J&J Surgical Robotics
  from: May 2022
  to: August 2022
  description: I designed custom test fixtures to ensure surgical robot components complied with regulatory standards and internal design constraints. 
    These fixtures required custom mechanical, electrical, and control systems and testing tasks included lifecycle, impact, and deflection testing 
    under applied loads. I programmed extensively in the Arduino IDE to integrate a suite of sensors, actuators, and manual user controls into a reliable test setup.

- title: Sustaining Engineering Intern, Formlabs
  from: May 2021
  to: August 2021
  description: I was on the Sustaining Engineering Team, where I diagnosed and resolved problems for SLA and SLS printers.
   Some projects included improving resin tracking accuracy scripts, 
   reducing packaging weight, and investigating the cause of poor LED 
   calibrations and unexpected RTD values.

- title: Manufacturing Engineering Intern, Tesla
  from: January 2021
  to: May 2021
  description: I was part of the Model 3 General Assembly Equipment Engineering Team, where I designed manufacturing equipment for 
    assembly line improvement projects. I worked with process, safety, and ergonomics teams to develop design constraints for
    equipment solutions that reduced headcount, cycle times, and factory space. I also worked with other manufacturing engineers 
    to develop and refine my designs and with fabrication shops to make the parts. Some of my projects included designing locking 
    dollies and docking stations to reliably transport vehicle components within the factory, as well as actuating door supports 
    that hold the Model 3 doors in the right place while bolts are installed.

- title: Mechanical Engineering Intern, Dupont
  from: August 2020
  to: December 2020
  description: I worked with mechanical and industrial engineers to improve the reliability and efficiency of manufacturing processes.
   Some projects included designing new equipment to reduce cycle times and increase tool longevity, visualizing and analyzing part 
   data from the testing lab, and using VBA to schedule maintenance tasks based on PM schedules and man hours available.
