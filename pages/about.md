# **About Me**

I'm Tyler - I'm a Master's Student studying robotics at the University of Michigan. I'm passionate about computer vision, deep learning, and anything robot related. I love learning how things work and working with other engineers to solve interesting problems. I'm currently a graduate researcher for the Field Robotics Group at the U of M, where I'm developing a deep learning pipeline for segmenting shipwrecks from terrain using multibeam sonar bathymetric data. 

I also really enjoy mechanical design and building things from scratch. I've built Battlebots, walking robots, and lots more.

When I'm not designing or building things, I like to spend time playing soccer, rock climbing, and looking for any excuse to be outdoors.
