# Autonomous Mobile Robot

## Overview
This was the second of two projects done in my Robotic Systems Lab class at the University of Michigan. The goal was to program a
mobile robot to use LIDAR-based SLAM to localize, map, and explore an unknown environment with obstacles. We additionally implemented
wheel calibration, PID control for wheel velocity tracking, A* path planning, and computer-vision based object manipulation.
I worked on this project with two other students, and played a key role in developing all of the 
algorithms.

This page gives a brief overview of the steps leading to autonomous mapping and exploration.
